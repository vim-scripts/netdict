Netdict is a plugin for the VIM editor to get word and other definitions from
the Internet via the `dict' command line client.

Type `make install' to install then fire up vim and run `:helptags ~/.vim/doc'
then `:h netdict' to view the manual.

Note that this plugin has only been tested with VIM 6.1 and that there aren't
any warrenties or guarantees.
